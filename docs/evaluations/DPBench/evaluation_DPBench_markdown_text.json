The main thing in this chapter is to show that completely symmetric boundary conditions at the endpoints may give rise to a broken time symmetry.\n\nThe multiverse now splits up into four different kinds of paths:\n\n- · LL: The entropy is low (=0) at both ends ( -m and m).\n- · LH: The entropy is 0 at -m and 2m at m.\n- · HL: The entropy is 2m at -m and 0 at m.\n- · HH: The entropy is high (= 2m) at both ends (-m and m).\n\nIf we now denote by NLL, NLH, NHL and NHH the number of paths of the indicated kinds, then with the above assumptions we also get the corresponding probability weights for the corresponding types as\n\nP\\_{LL}=N\\_{LL},\\quadP\\_{LH}=pN\\_{LH},\\quadP\\_{HL}=pN\\_{HL},\\quadP\\_{HH}=p^2N\\_{HH}.\n\nWe can now consider the following two types of broken time symmetry: Definition 4. A multiverse is said to exhibit a weak broken time symmetry if\n\nP\\_{LL}\\llP\\_{LH}+P\\_{HL}.\n\nDefinition 5.

As shown in Table 3.1.1., a majority of tourism and handicraft/ textile MSMEs were temporarily closed during the\n\nlockdown period. In the handicraft/textile sector, 30% of MSMEs were temporarily closed as of July 2020, reducing to 12% in January 2021. Similarly, in tourism, 27% of businesses were temporarily closed as of July 2020 and that reduced to 18% in January 2021. Figure 3.1.1 and Table 3.1.1 do not reflect those MSMEs who were permanently closed; this was four in July 2020, 22 in October 2020, and 24 in January 2021. Of these 50 businesses who permanently closed during the research period, 30 were in the tourism sector, 18 in handicraft/textile, and two in agriculture."

Historians  argue  that  Spain's  strong Catholic traditions ushered in patriarchal norms and practices that were not present in the pre-Hispanic period.

Historians also found proof of women's contribution to the Philippine revolution (Camagay 1998). Decades later, the suffragist movement ushered in one of the first national issues to have brought Filipino women together. It was a hardfought battle; the movement had to contend with staunch opposition from antisuffragists in the Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1935 Constitution. The reluctance was expected because only 21-yearold Filipino men had been allowed to vote during the time. They framed their opposition based on traditional notions of womanhood and their role in the private sphere, foremost of which is motherhood. Another key  argument  against  female  suffrage  was  the  idea  that  politics  is supposed to be 'dirty' and that this would taint families if women took part in politics.

This is because palm oil is the main raw material for biodiesel in Indonesia.\n\nCPO is the primary product derived from the red fruit of the oil palm, while palm kernel oil,  derived  from  the  fruit's  nut,  is  considered  a  secondary product. Oil palm biomass includes EFBs, palm mesocarps fibres (PMFs), PKS, oil palm fronds, oil palm trunks, as well as palm oil mill effluent (POME). Oil palm fronds account for 70% of the total oil palm biomass produced, while EFB accounts for 10% and oil palm trunks account for only about 5% of the total biomass produced.\n\nAccording to Harahap et al. (2019), Indonesia housed 11 million hectares (Mha) of oil palm plantations and produced 31 million tonnes (Mt) of CPO in 2015. Oil extraction from palm fruits occurs in palm oil mills. One tonne (t) of CPO production results in nearly 5 t of solid biomass waste, including EFBs, PKSs, PMFs, and POME; see Figure 3.3. This implies that, in 2015, Indonesia produced around 155 Mt of palm biomass residue.\n\nFigure 3.3. Biomass Use in Oil Palm Industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Harahap et al.

This is because palm oil is the main raw material for biodiesel in Indonesia.\n\nCPO is the primary product derived from the red fruit of the oil palm, while palm kernel oil, derived from the fruit's nut, is considered a secondary product. Oil palm biomass includes EFBs, palm mesocarps fibres (PMFs), PKS, oil palm fronds, oil palm trunks, as well as palm oil mill effluent (POME). Oil palm fronds account for 70% of the total oil palm biomass produced, while EFB accounts for 10% and oil palm trunks account for only about 5% of the total biomass produced.\n\nAccording to Harahap et al. (2019), Indonesia housed 11 million hectares (Mha) of oil palm plantations and produced 31 million tonnes (Mt) of CPO in 2015. Oil extraction from palm fruits occurs in palm oil mills. One tonne (t) of CPO production results in nearly 5 t of solid biomass waste, including EFBs, PKSs, PMFs, and POME; see Figure 3.3. This implies that, in 2015, Indonesia produced around 155 Mt of palm biomass residue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Harahap et al.

Natural dispersal\n\nDispersal by purely natural means is not included as a pathway of biological invasions (Gaston 1996). Examples include range expansion by flight or any other medium of natural locomotion or transport. However if human created or crafted material is involved in rafting dispersal of IAS, then  this  may  be  considered  as  a  case  of  biological  invasion.    The  2011  Great  East  Japan earthquake generated a large tsunami that caused an unprecedented biological transoceanic rafting event from the northwestern Pacific coastline of Japan towards North America on the eastern Pacific(Carlton et al. 2017). Millions of human made objects from small plastics to large docks  and  whole  ships  were  cast  adrift  in  the  Pacific  (Murray  et  al.  2018).  This  provided  a substrate  for  biofoulers.  Large  debris  could  carry  up  to  20  to  30  mega-species  of  biofoulers (Carlton et al. 2017).

Examples include range expansion by flight or any other medium of natural locomotion or transport. However if human created or crafted material is involved in rafting dispersal of IAS, then this may be considered as a case of biological invasion. The 2011 Great East Japan earthquake generated a large tsunami that caused an unprecedented biological transoceanic rafting event from the northwestern Pacific coastline of Japan towards North America on the eastern Pacific(Carlton et al. 2017). Millions of human made objects from small plastics to large docks and whole ships were cast adrift in the Pacific (Murray et al. 2018). This provided a substrate for biofoulers. Large debris could carry up to 20 to 30 mega-species of biofoulers (Carlton et al. 2017).

The return of migrant workers to their home countries contributed to significant labour shortages (Lee and David, 2021; Sriring and Staporncharnchai, 2021).4 COVID-related movement restrictions caused many workers to withdraw from the labour force (especially women) and labour force participation rates declined in most countries.5 This was the case for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam (Figure 1.4). According to the ILO (2021c), female employment in AMS in 2020 was 3.9 percent lower than the expected level, which is markedly less than the 2.7 percent figure for male employment.6 The impact of the pandemic on employment is evident in lower labour force participation, lower working hours, and higher unemployment rates in most countries (Figure 1.5).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: ILO (2022a)"

Migrant Workers More at Risk of COVID-19 Infection\n\nCOVID-19  infection  among  migrants  appears  to  be  higher  than  among non-migrant  groups  (Hintermeier  et  al.,  2020).  Migrant  workers  are disproportionately  exposed  to  COVID-19  because  of  the  nature  of  their work and their living conditions. Many migrant workers performed essential services, including jobs in healthcare, selected manufacturing, transportation, logistics, construction, and maintenance, which continued during periods of movement restrictions (OECD, ADBI and ILO, 2021). Many migrant workers also have less access to personal protective equipment and testing and treatment facilities (OECD, ADBI and ILO, 2021). The lack of access was especially true for undocumented migrants.\n\nAdditionally, migrant workers employed in plantations far away from urban centres had limited access to information and testing. High rates of infection were also linked to overcrowded housing conditions, including shared facilities and sleeping areas, which increase the risk of transmission (ASEAN MP, 2021). Many workers in processing or assembly plants worked in conditions where physical distancing was rarely observed.\n\nIn Malaysia, out of 2,188 positive cases recorded nationwide on 25 November 2020, 1,511 were foreign workers employed by Top Glove Corporation Bhd., one of the world's largest personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturers ( The Straits Times , 2020; Ngui, 2020).

Inflation in the 1970s, for instance, was not caused by hoarders and speculators; it was a matter of supply and demand. \"Excoriating, coercing, or imprisoning the hoarders and speculators changes nothing in terms of creating new supply,\" write Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah.28 \"The economic theory of people hostile to economic forces is wrong.\"\n\nBy taking one policy tool - imprisonment - this report highlights the excesses of overregulation and the resultant regulatory cholesterol while doing business in India. Although the biggest constituency at the receiving end of these laws is that of entrepreneurs running for- profit firms and corporations, this regulatory overreach also impacts not-for-profits such as schools and hospitals-both necessary institutions for India with a huge demand.

Studying  and  practicing  behavioral  economics  should  occur simultaneously, which, in turn, suggests a course taught more according to a practicum approach than in a traditionally styled lecture format. As such, the book's information and lessons are presented in a succinct and precise format.\n\nThe  goal  of  this  textbook  is  to  help  students  experience  behavioral  economics  through  actual participation in the same experiments and economic games that have served as the foundations for, and shaped the contours of, the field. With the help of this book, students have the opportunity to learn behavioral economics firsthand and, in the process, create their own data and experiences. They will learn about themselves-about how they make private and public choices under experimental conditions-at the same time as they learn about the field of behavioral economics itself. They will be both the subjects and students of behavioral economics. What better way to learn?\n\n## HOMO ECONOMICUS VS. HOMO SAPIENS\n\nFor ease of reference and exposition, we henceforth refer to the type of individual construed by the traditional rational-choice model as Homo economicus ,  a peculiar subspecies of human beings that is unfailingly  omniscient,  dispassionate,  and  self-interested  when  it  comes  to  making  choices. Homo sapiens ,  on  the  other  hand,  represents  the  rest  of  us-the  often-flawed  reasoners  and  sometimesaltruistic  competitors  who  are  prone  to  making  decisions  based  primarily  on  emotion  and heuristics. 1 , 2\n\n## THE TEXTBOOK'S DIFFERENT SECTIONS\n\nThe textbook consists of four sections that, taken together, portray in full the eclectic methodologies comprising  the  field  of  behavioral  economics.  Sections  1  and  2  present  the  thought  and  actual\n\n- 1. Homo economicus is Latin for 'economic man.' Persky (1995) traces its use back to the late 1800s when it was used by critics of John Stuart Mill's work on political economy. In contrast (and, as we will see, with no small touch of irony) Homo sapiens is Latin for 'wise man.' For a deep dive into evolution of Homo sapiens , particularly from the start of the Cognitive Revolution 70,000 years ago, see Harari (2015).\n- 2. We have all heard the saying that 'words matter.' The titles and descriptions we use to distinguish people and their behaviors (e.g., Homo economicus vs. Homo sapiens ) can reinforce or diminish behaviors such as pride in cultural heritage, respect for the living world, and trust in community, a process known as 'crowding out' of 'intrinsic motivation and commitment.' As an example of this phenomenon, Bauer et al. (2012) asked participants in an online survey to imagine themselves as one of four households facing a water shortage due to a drought affecting their shared well. The survey assigned the label 'consumers' to half of the participants and 'individuals' to the other half. Those imagining themselves as consumers reported feeling less personal responsibility to reduce their water demand, and less trust in others to do the same, than did those referred to as individuals. As we are about to learn, behavioral economics is all about exposing these types of 'framing effects' existing in the 'real world' inhabited by Homo sapiens .",

The thought experiments in Section 1 are, for the most part, re-castings of the simple cognitive tests devised by psychologists and economists over the past three-to-four decades to illustrate the fallacies, miscalculations, and biases distinguishing Homo sapiens from Homo economicus . Similarly, the laboratory experiments presented in Section 2 are, for the most part, re-castings of the seminal experiments conducted by Kahneman and Tversky (among many others). These experiments helped motivate the revised theories of human choice behavior, such as Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) Prospect Theory, which form another pillar of behavioral economics. Alongside these experiments, Section 2 presents the revised theories of human choice behavior with varying  degrees  of  rigor.  This  is  where  the  theoretical  bases  of Homo  economicus '  rational  choice behavior  are  examined,  and  where  key  refinements  to  this  theory  are  developed-theoretical refinements  underpinning  the  myriad  departures  from  rational  choice  behavior  we  witness Homo sapiens make in this section's laboratory and field experiments (and which are examined further in Sections 3 and 4).\n\nSection 3 submerses the student in the world of behavioral game theory. Here we explore games such  as  Ultimatum  Bargaining  presented  in  Example  5.  We  follow  Camerer  (2003)'s  lead,  first  by characterizing  the  games  analytically  (i.e.,  identifying  solution,  or  equilibrium,  concepts  that  are predicted  to  result  when  members  of Homo  economicus play  the  games),  and  then  by  discussing empirical  results  obtained  from  corresponding  field  experiments  conducted  with Homo sapiens .  It is  within  the  context  of  these  games  and  field  experiments  that  theories  of  social  interaction  are tested concerning inter alia trust and trustworthiness, honesty, fairness, reciprocity, etc. As with the thought and laboratory experiments presented in Sections 1 and 2, the games and field experiments presented in Section 3 are meant to be replicated with students as subjects and the instructor as the experimenter, or researcher.\n\nFinally, Section 4 wades into the vast sea of empirical research and choice architecture. Here the student explores studies reporting on (1) the outcomes of actual policy nudges, such as the SMarT retirement-savings plan presented in Example 3 of the Introduction, (2) analyses of secondary datasets to test for choice behavior consistent with the revised theories discussed in Section 2, such as the test for loss aversion in Example 4 of the Introduction, and (3) analyses of primary datasets obtained from novel field experiments to further test the revised theories. The main purpose of this section is not only to introduce the student to interesting empirical studies and policy adaptations in the field of behavioral economics, but also, in the process, to incubate in the student an abiding appreciation for the obscure settings that sometimes lend themselves to such study. 3\n\n## THE TEXTBOOK'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RIGOR\n\nBecause  the  mathematical  and  computational  rigor  of  material  presented  in  this  textbook  varies throughout,  particularly  in  Sections  2  -  4,  the  extent  of  the  rigor  used  in  the  presentation  of  a given  topic  is  indicated  with  superscripts.

Similarly, the laboratory experiments presented in Section 2 are, for the most part, re-castings of the seminal experiments conducted by Kahneman and Tversky (among many others). These experiments helped motivate the revised theories of human choice behavior, such as Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) Prospect Theory, which form another pillar of behavioral economics. Alongside these experiments, Section 2 presents the revised theories of human choice behavior with varying degrees of rigor. This is where the theoretical bases of Homo economicus' rational choice behavior are examined, and where key refinements to this theory are developed-theoretical refinements underpinning the myriad departures from rational choice behavior we witness Homo sapiens make in this section's laboratory and field experiments (and which are examined further in Sections 3 and 4).\n\nSection 3 submerses the student in the world of behavioral game theory. Here we explore games such as Ultimatum Bargaining presented in Example 5. We follow Camerer (2003)'s lead, first by characterizing the games analytically (i.e., identifying solution, or equilibrium, concepts that are predicted to result when members of Homo economicus play the games), and then by discussing empirical results obtained from corresponding field experiments conducted with Homo sapiens. It is within the context of these games and field experiments that theories of social interaction are tested concerning inter alia trust and trustworthiness, honesty, fairness, reciprocity, etc. As with the thought and laboratory experiments presented in Sections 1 and 2, the games and field experiments presented in Section 3 are meant to be replicated with students as subjects and the instructor as the experimenter, or researcher.\n\nFinally, Section 4 wades into the vast sea of empirical research and choice architecture. Here the student explores studies reporting on (1) the outcomes of actual policy nudges, such as the SMarT retirement-savings plan presented in Example 3 of the Introduction, (2) analyses of secondary datasets to test for choice behavior consistent with the revised theories discussed in Section 2, such as the test for loss aversion in Example 4 of the Introduction, and (3) analyses of primary datasets obtained from novel field experiments to further test the revised theories. The main purpose of this section is not only to introduce the student to interesting empirical studies and policy adaptations in the field of behavioral economics, but also, in the process, to incubate in the student an abiding appreciation for the obscure settings that sometimes lend themselves to such study.3\n\n## THE TEXTBOOK'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RIGOR\n\nBecause the mathematical and computational rigor of material presented in this textbook varies throughout, particularly in Sections 2 - 4, the extent of the rigor used in the presentation of a given topic is indicated with superscripts. Topics without a superscript are considered basic and universal enough that backgrounds in economics, mathematics, or statistics are not required for the reader to understand the material. Topics with a single asterisk (*) indicate that higher mathematical reasoning skills are recommended for the reader to fully grasp the material. Topics with a double"

That's what a social relationship delivers.' (page 90)\n\nHence, in the less-predictable world of Homo sapiens ,  businesses must decide the extent to which they participate with their employees and customers in monetary and/or social markets.\n\nAs a follow-on to Heyman and Ariely's (2004) experiments exploring the payment-effort trade-off, Vohs et al. (2006) sought to understand the behavioral psychology underscoring the trade-off. In its most general terms, the authors' hypothesis is that money makes Homo sapiens feel self-sufficient and behave accordingly. When reminded of money, people desire to be free from dependency upon others and prefer that others not depend upon them. Vohs et al. designed several experiments to test this hypothesis from a variety of angles.\n\nIn  one  experiment,  the  authors  found  that  participants  (a  sample  of  University  of  Minnesota students) who were reminded about money-both Monopoly money and real money-in the context of a series of word descrambling tasks worked longer at the tasks than participants in a non-moneyprimed control group before requesting help from the experimenter. 25 In  subsequent  experiments with different groups of students, Vohs et al. found that (1) participants in a high-money treatment worked significantly longer than participants in a low-money treatment before asking for help from another available participant, (2) participants in a money-primed treatment volunteered to help code fewer data sheets than did participants in the non-money-primed control condition, (3) participants in a high-money treatment volunteered to gather fewer pencils that had spilled onto the floor than did participants in a low-money treatment, and (4) participants in a money-primed treatment donated significantly  less  money  to  a  university  student  fund  than  participants  in  the  non-money  primed control. Three final experiments tested the effects of money on social intimacy, desire to engage in leisure activities alone, and preference to work alone. As expected, participants who were primed with money ahead of time were subsequently less socially intimate and exhibited a stronger preference for engaging in leisure activities and working alone.\n\nSo yes,  Vohs  et  al.'s  experiments  suggest  that  money  makes Homo sapiens feel  self-sufficient  and behave accordingly.\n\n## PRICE AND THE PLACEBO EFFECT\n\nIs it possible that the magnitudes of placebo effects experienced by Homo sapiens (e.g., through medical therapies  or  medications)  are  somehow  influenced  by  the  prices  we  pay  for  them?  To  investigate this possibility, Waber et al. (2008) studied the effect of price on a group of Homo sapiens '  analgesic responses to placebo pills. Over 80 healthy volunteers in Boston, MA were recruited via an online advertisement to participate in a field experiment where each participant was informed by a brochure about a purported new opioid analgesic recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The opioid was described as similar to codeine but with a faster onset time. In reality, and not disclosed to the participants, the pill was a placebo.

That's what a social relationship delivers.\" (page 90)\n\nHence, in the less-predictable world of Homo sapiens, businesses must decide the extent to which they participate with their employees and customers in monetary and/or social markets.\n\nAs a follow-on to Heyman and Ariely's (2004) experiments exploring the payment-effort trade-off, Vohs et al. (2006) sought to understand the behavioral psychology underscoring the trade-off. In its most general terms, the authors' hypothesis is that money makes Homo sapiens feel self-sufficient and behave accordingly. When reminded of money, people desire to be free from dependency upon others and prefer that others not depend upon them. Vohs et al. designed several experiments to test this hypothesis from a variety of angles.\n\nIn one experiment, the authors found that participants (a sample of University of Minnesota students) who were reminded about money-both Monopoly money and real money-in the context of a series of word descrambling tasks worked longer at the tasks than participants in a non-money- primed control group before requesting help from the experimenter.25 In subsequent experiments with different groups of students, Vohs et al. found that (1) participants in a high-money treatment worked significantly longer than participants in a low-money treatment before asking for help from another available participant, (2) participants in a money-primed treatment volunteered to help code fewer data sheets than did participants in the non-money-primed control condition, (3) participants in a high-money treatment volunteered to gather fewer pencils that had spilled onto the floor than did participants in a low-money treatment, and (4) participants in a money-primed treatment donated significantly less money to a university student fund than participants in the non-money primed control. Three final experiments tested the effects of money on social intimacy, desire to engage in leisure activities alone, and preference to work alone. As expected, participants who were primed with money ahead of time were subsequently less socially intimate and exhibited a stronger preference for engaging in leisure activities and working alone.\n\nSo yes, Vohs et al.'s experiments suggest that money makes Homo sapiens feel self-sufficient and behave accordingly.\n\n## PRICE AND THE PLACEBO EFFECT\n\nIs it possible that the magnitudes of placebo effects experienced by Homo sapiens (e.g., through medical therapies or medications) are somehow influenced by the prices we pay for them? To investigate this possibility, Waber et al. (2008) studied the effect of price on a group of Homo sapiens' analgesic responses to placebo pills. Over 80 healthy volunteers in Boston, MA were recruited via an online advertisement to participate in a field experiment where each participant was informed by a brochure about a purported new opioid analgesic recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The opioid was described as similar to codeine but with a faster onset time. In reality, and not disclosed to the participants, the pill was a placebo. After randomization, half of the participants were informed that the drug had a regular price of $2.50 per pill (\"regular price\"), and half of the participants that"

As Akbulut-Yuksel and Boulatoff point out, under the new policy, households were mandated to replace their black garbage bags, traditionally used for the disposal of their refuse, with clear, transparent bags. The Clear Bag Policy allowed households to put out the same number of garbage bags at the curb (six every other week), but all waste destined for the landfill was required to be disposed of in a clear bag (except for one dark bag permitted for privacy's sake). This allowed waste collectors to screen and refuse any bags containing materials that should otherwise have been diverted from the landfill, such as recyclables, food waste, and hazardous waste.

As Akbulut-Yuksel and Boulatoff point out, Halifax households are required to sort waste in four ways: (1) recyclable containers (plastics, glass, and aluminum) are put in a transparent blue bag, (2) paper and cardboard are put in a separate bag, (3) organic food waste goes in a green bin provided by the city, and (4) the remaining waste (refuse) goes into garbage bags. Recyclable materials are collected each week, while garbage and organic waste are each collected every other week on opposite weeks (except in the summer months when, thank goodness, organic waste is collected on a weekly basis). 234  ARTHUR J.

The advantage of using a critical Reynolds number, instead of critical velocity, is that the results of the experiments are applicable to all Newtonian fluid flows in pipes with a circular cross- section.\n\n|   Temperature (degree C) |   Kinematic viscosity v (m2/s) |   Temperature (degree C) |   Kinematic viscosity v (m2/s) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                        0 |                      1.793e-06 |                       25 |                       8.93e-07 |\n|                        1 |                      1.732e-06 |                       26 |                       8.76e-07 |\n|                        2 |                      1.674e-06 |                       27 |                       8.54e-07 |\n|                        3 |                      1.619e-06 |                       28 |                       8.36e-07 |\n|                        4 |                      1.522e-06 |                       29 |                       8.18e-07 |\n|                        5 |                      1.52e-06  |                       30 |                       8.02e-07 |\n|                        6 |                      1.474e-06 |                       31 |                       7.85e-07 |\n|                        7 |                      1.429e-06 |                       32 |                       7.69e-07 |\n|                        8 |                      1.386e-06 |                       33 |                       7.53e-07 |\n|                        9 |                      1.346e-06 |                       34 |                       7.38e-07 |\n|                       10 |                      1.307e-06 |                       35 |                       7.24e-07 |\n|                       11 |                      1.27e-06  |                       36 |                       7.11e-07 |\n|                       12 |                      1.235e-06 |                       37 |                       6.97e-07 |\n|                       13 |                      1.201e-06 |                       38 |                       6.84e-07 |\n|                       14 |                      1.169e-06 |                       39 |                       6.71e-07 |\n|                       15 |                      1.138e-06 |                       40 |                       6.58e-07 |\n|                       16 |                      1.108e-06 |                       45 |                       6.02e-07 |\n|                       17 |                      1.08e-06  |                       50 |                       5.54e-07 |\n|                       18 |                      1.053e-06 |                       55 |                       5.11e-07 |\n|                       19 |                      1.027e-06 |                       60 |                       4.76e-07 |\n|                       20 |                      1.002e-06 |                       65 |                       4.43e-07 |\n|                       21 |                      9.78e-07  |                       70 |                       4.13e-07 |\n|                       22 |                      9.55e-07  |                       75 |                       3.86e-07 |\n|                       23 |                      9.33e-07  |                       80 |                       3.63e-07 |\n|                       24 |                      9.11e-07  |                       85 |                       3.42e-07 |"

By now hopefully you've noticed that these processes are denoted with \"2n\" and \"n\" in various places. This is a reference to the number of sets of chromosomes that cell has at any given moment. Autosomal human cells are 2n. Gametes are 1n. Mitosis begins with one 2n cell and ends with two 2n cells. Meiosis begins with one 2n cell and ends with 4 1n cells. Sketch those two processes here to show every time the \"n\" classification changes. (Hint: draw every step, it'll make your life easier, evenif it takes a little bit longer!)"

Because of the half-year convention, it takes 4 years to depreciate the asset, even though it falls into the 3-year classification.\n\nDepreciation expense for the same asset using the MACRS method would be calculated as:\n\n|   Year |   Recovery Rate | Unadjusted Basis   | Depreciation Expense   | Accumulated Depreciation   |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n|      1 |          0.3333 | $100,000           | $33,333                | $33,333                    |\n|      2 |          0.4445 | $100,000           | $44,450                | $77,780                    |\n|      3 |          0.1481 | $100,000           | $14,810                | $92,950                    |\n|      4 |          0.741  | $100,000           | $7,410                 | $100,000                   |\n\nNote again that the depreciation expense using MACRS is higher in the early years and lower in later years than with the SL method and that the book value after 4 years is again zero. Businesses often use MACRS for tax purposes and SL for profit reporting. Can you think of any reasons why?\n\nSome businesses that invest small amounts in capital assets are allowed to deduct up to $1,000,000 of the cost of acquired depreciable property as a current expenditure instead of a capital expenditure. This is known as direct expensing, and is available only to businesses that don't make large capital purchases each year.

Using the SL method, the depreciation expense each year for the next 3 years would be:\n\n|   Year |   Recovery Rate | Unadjusted Basis   | Depreciation Expense   | Accumulated Depreciation   |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n|      1 |          0.1667 | $100,000           | $16,670                | $16,670                    |\n|      2 |          0.3333 | $100,000           | $33,330                | $50,000                    |\n|      3 |          0.3333 | $100,000           | $33,330                | $88,330                    |\n|      4 |          0.1667 | $100,000           | $16,670                | $100,000                   |\n\nNote that the book value or basis of the asset (acquisition cost - accumulated depreciation) would be $0 after it has been fully depreciated at the end of 4 years. Because of the half-year convention, it takes 4 years to depreciate the asset, even though it falls into the 3-year classification.\n\nDepreciation expense for the same asset using the MACRS method would be calculated as:\n\n|   Year |   Recovery Rate | Unadjusted Basis   | Depreciation Expense   | Accumulated Depreciation   |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n|      1 |          0.3333 | $100,000           | $33,333                | $33,333                    |\n|      2 |          0.4445 | $100,000           | $44,450                | $77,780                    |\n|      3 |          0.1481 | $100,000           | $14,810                | $92,950                    |\n|      4 |          0.741  | $100,000           | $7,410                 | $100,000                   |\n\nNote again that the depreciation expense using MACRS is higher in the early years and lower in later years than with the SL method and that the book value after 4 years is again zero. Businesses often use MACRS for tax purposes and SL for profit reporting. Can you think of any reasons why?\n\nSome businesses that invest small amounts in capital assets are allowed to deduct up to $1,000,000 of the cost of acquired depreciable property as a current expenditure instead of a capital expenditure. This is known as direct expensing, and is available only to businesses that don't make large capital purchases each year. The allowable expensing amount is reduced by one dollar for each dollar of capital investment expenditure over $2,500,000 during the year. Other restrictions also apply."

Here I review the history of trout fishing and fly-fishing with special focus on the Rocky Mountain West, where fly fishers first exerted their influence on conservation ethics and sportfishing policy. Although many individuals and organizations played roles, I concentrate on only two: Fly Fishers International (FFI) and Trout Unlimited (TU). These two organizations had similar interests in conservation, but important differences prevented them from working together on a unified goal of conservation. The legacy of fly-fishing demonstrates the importance of passion, persistence, and partnerships in fish conservation.\n\nTrout and salmon are the only sport fish native to the Western states, and fly-fishing here became more than a leisure activity. Norman Maclean's novel, A River Runs through It (1976), begins, 'In our family there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.' Later Maclean writes that 'Something within fishermen 1 tries  to make fishing into a world perfect and apart.' The iconography of Western fly-fishing that Maclean and others wrote about was created by anglers, fisheries managers, tourists, guides, businesses, and region promoters. The history of Rocky Mountain fly-fishing parallels the history of the expansion of our Western frontier as well as fisheries management (Brown 2015). Although Henry David Thoreau (1862) maintained that 'In wildness is the preservation of the world,' humans are part of the trout fishing system and helped create, destroy, maintain, and restore the trout fishing we have today.\n\nThe first trout fishers were Native Americans. Native Americans used a variety of fishing methods, including weirs, spears, nets, traps, baskets, hook-and-line methods, and baits. They also caught fish by hand via tickling. Tickling for trout involves rubbing the underbelly of a trout with fingers to get the trout to go into a trance, after which they can then easily be thrown onto the bank (Martindale 1901). Native Americans were more patient than others. This method is different from noodling for catfish, where the noodler uses fingers as bait and grabs the catfish by its mouth. Native Americans also caught fish by fly-fishing with deer-hair flies, according to the writings of early American naturalist William Bartram (1739-1823) (Monahan, no date).\n\nThe story of Rocky Mountain trout fishing begins with displacement of Native Americans from their historical fishing and hunting grounds. Uninhabited wilderness had to be created through the dispossession of Native people before it could be preserved (Spence 1999). Explorers, trappers, pioneers, soldiers, and homesteaders brought fishing gear to frontier outposts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) included a designated angler  named  Silas  Goodrich.  The  expedition  first  described  several  new  species  of  fish,  including  the Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout, caught by Goodrich. Later military expeditions spent time trout fishing in addition to fighting Native Americans. Custer's Last Stand at Little Bighorn might have been avoided if he'd joined a column of reinforcements under General George Crook.

Long description.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCreel  limits  are  one  of  many  elements  that  may  be  used  by  anglers  to  define  fishing  success.  When  more fish are harvested per trip, anglers rate fishing higher. High creel limits may cause anglers to have unrealistic expectations  about  the  potential  supply  of  fish  compared  to  the  demand  (Cook  et  al.  2001).  Creel  limit reductions  may  be  unsuccessful  in  reducing  angler  harvest  or  affecting  fish  populations.  The  hypothetical angler success graph (Figure 10.5) demonstrates that a reduction in creel from 8 to 4 would affect only a few trips and result in a small harvest reduction. Furthermore, creel limits are applied on a per-angler basis, so they cannot control total harvest if total fishing effort increases or if noncompliance is high. Finally, since anglers have a variety of motivations, they likely respond differently to regulation changes (Beard et al. 2011).\n\nThe ethic of fairness is involved in setting creel limit regulations because many anglers do not harvest a single fish during an angling trip. In Wisconsin lakes, Walleye harvest was not equally distributed. Only 7.4% of Walleye angler trips were successful in harvesting at least one Walleye, and <1% harvested a limit during a fishing trip (Staggs 1989). In Minnesota, anglers were slightly more successful, where 27.2% of angler trips ended with a harvest of at least one Walleye and about 1% harvesting a limit. The ideal creel limit would distribute the catch among more anglers and prevent overuse by a few individuals.\n\nLong-term trends in panfish populations (i.e., Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass) in Wisconsin lakes showed significant declines due to overfishing (Rypel et al. 2016). The daily limit for panfish was 50 aggregate per day from 1967 through 1998, which was reduced to 25 in 1998. Further reduction in daily limits for panfish (10) to improve undesirable small sizes of Bluegill populations increased both mean length and mean maximum length relative to sizes in control lakes (Jacobson 2005; Rypel et al. 2015).",

In Minnesota, anglers were slightly more successful, where 27.2% of angler trips ended with a harvest of at least one Walleye and about 1% harvesting a limit. The ideal creel limit would distribute the catch among more anglers and prevent overuse by a few individuals.\n\nLong-term trends in panfish populations (i.e., Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass) in Wisconsin lakes showed significant declines due to overfishing (Rypel et al. 2016). The daily limit for panfish was 50 aggregate per day from 1967 through 1998, which was reduced to 25 in 1998. Further reduction in daily limits for panfish (10) to improve undesirable small sizes of Bluegill populations increased both mean length and mean maximum length relative to sizes in control lakes (Jacobson 2005; Rypel et al. 2015)."

The reserve and saltreplaceable acidity is always many times higher than the active acidity.\n\nA soil is acid when hydrogen ions predominate in the soil.

Soils in areas with high rainfall are generally acid with a pH less than 7. Soils developed in high-lime deposits often will be alkaline.

Your laboratory instructor assigned a treatment to your group, and you completed the following steps:\n\n- 1. Label four plastic bags 2. Weigh 20 g of air-dry soil into each plastic bag. 3. Weigh 0.1 gram of designated liming material onto weighing paper. 4. Add the liming material to the soil and mix thoroughly to distribute evenly in the soil. 5. Add a few mL of water to each bag and mix. 6. Close the bags to start incubation.\n\nNow that the liming agents have had time to react, you will collect the results."

Only in the vacuum of space can optical elements be cooled to hundreds of degrees below freezing and still remain operational.\n\nThe first orbiting infrared observatory, launched in 1983, was the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), built as a joint project by the United States, the Netherlands, and Britain. IRAS was equipped with a 0.6-meter telescope cooled to a temperature of less than 10 K. For the first time, the infrared sky could be seen as if it were night, rather than through a bright foreground of atmospheric and telescope emissions.

Since then, several other infrared telescopes have operated in space with much better sensitivity and resolution due to improvements in infrared detectors. The most powerful of these infrared telescopes is the 0.85-meter Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003. A few of its observations are shown in Figure 2.

The  Open  Education  Week  website  lists  past  events  and  provides  downloadable  promotional materials to help you kickstart your event planning and coordination.

Inspired by recent efforts to efficiently up-scale LLMs, we present a method for scaling LLMs called depth up-scaling (DUS), which encompasses depthwise scaling and continued pretraining. In contrast to other LLM up-scaling methods that use mixture-of-experts, DUS does not require complex changes to train and inference efficiently. We show experimentally that DUS is simple yet effective in scaling up highperformance LLMs from small ones. Building on the DUS model, we additionally present SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct, a variant fine-tuned for instruction-following capabilities, surpassing Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct. SOLAR 10.7B is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license, promoting broad access and application in the LLM field 1 .\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has been significantly transformed by the introduction of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced our understanding and interaction with human language (Zhang et al., 2023a). These advancements bring challenges such as the increased need to train ever larger models (Rae et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023; Lian, 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Gesmundo and Maile, 2023) owing to the performance scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021; Anil et al., 2023; Kaddour et al., 2023). To efficiently tackle the above, recent works in scaling language models such as a mixture of experts (MoE) (Shazeer et al., 2017; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022) have been proposed.

Effectively and efficiently scaling up LLMs whilst also retaining the simplicity for ease of use is an important problem (Alberts et al., 2023; Fraiwan and Khasawneh, 2023; Sallam et al., 2023; Bahrini et al., 2023).\n\nInspired by Komatsuzaki et al. (2022), we present depth up-scaling (DUS), an effective and efficient method to up-scale LLMs whilst also remaining straightforward to use. DUS consists of scaling the base model along the depth dimension and continually pretraining the scaled model. Unlike (Komatsuzaki et al., 2022), DUS does not scale the model using MoE and rather use a depthwise scaling method analogous to Tan and Le (2019) which is adapted for the LLM architecture. Thus, there are no additional modules or dynamism as with MoE, making DUS immediately compatible with easy-to-use LLM frameworks such as HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2019) with no changes to the training or inference framework for maximal efficiency.

While existing methods such as Komatsuzaki et al. (2022) use MoE(Shazeer et al., 2017) to scale-up the model architecture, we opt for a different depthwise scaling strategy inspired by Tan and Le (2019). We then continually pretrain the scaled model as just scaling the model without further pretraining degrades the performance.\n\nBase model. Any n -layer transformer architecture can be used but we select the 32-layer Llama 2 architecture as our base model. We initialize the Llama 2 architecture with pretrained weights from Mistral 7B, as it is one of the top performers compatible with the Llama 2 architecture. By adopting the Llama 2 architecture for our base model, we aim to leverage the vast pool of community resources while introducing novel modifications to further enhance its capabilities.\n\nDepthwise scaling. From the base model with n layers, we set the target layer count s for the scaled model, which is largely dictated by the available hardware.\n\nWith the above, the depthwise scaling process is as follows. The base model with n layers is duplicated for subsequent modification. Then, we remove the final m layers from the original model and the initial m layers from its duplicate, thus forming two distinct models with n -m layers. These two models are concatenated to form a scaled model with s = 2 · ( n -m ) layers. Note that n = 32 from our base model and we set s = 48 considering\n\nour hardware constraints and the efficiency of the scaled model, i.e., fitting between 7 and 13 billion parameters. Naturally, this leads to the removal of m = 8 layers. The depthwise scaling process with n = 32 , s = 48 , and m = 8 is depicted in 'Step 1: Depthwise Scaling' of Fig. 1.\n\nWenote that a method in the community that also scale the model in the same manner 2 as 'Step 1: Depthwise Scaling' of Fig. 1 has been concurrently developed.\n\nContinued pretraining. The performance of the depthwise scaled model initially drops below that of the base LLM. Thus, we additionally apply the continued pretraining step as shown in 'Step 2: Continued Pretraining' of Fig. 1. Experimentally, we observe rapid performance recovery of the scaled model during continued pretraining, a phenomenon also observed in Komatsuzaki et al. (2022). We consider that the particular way of depthwise scaling has isolated the heterogeneity in the scaled model which allowed for this fast performance recovery.\n\nDelving deeper into the heterogeneity of the scaled model, a simpler alternative to depthwise scaling could be to just repeat its layers once more, i.e., from n to 2 n layers. Then, the 'layer distance', or the difference in the layer indices in the base model, is only bigger than 1 where layers n and n +1 are connected, i.e., at the seam.\n\nHowever, this results in maximum layer distance at the seam, which may be too significant of a discrepancy for continued pretraining to quickly resolve.

We attribute the success of DUS to reducing such discrepancies in both the depthwise scaling and the continued pretraining steps. We also hypothesize that other methods of depthwise scaling could also work for DUS, as long as the discrepancy in the scaled model is sufficiently contained before the continued pretraining step.\n\nComparison to other up-scaling methods. Unlike Komatsuzaki et al. (2022), depthwise scaled models do not require additional modules like gating networks or dynamic expert selection. Consequently, scaled models in DUS do not necessitate a distinct training framework for optimal training efficiency, nor do they require specialized CUDA kernels for fast inference. A DUS model can seamlessly integrate into existing training and inference frameworks while maintaining high efficiency.\n\n## 3 Training Details\n\nAfter DUS, including continued pretraining, we perform fine-tuning of SOLAR 10.7B in two stages: 1) instruction tuning and 2) alignment tuning.\n\nInstruction tuning. In the instruction tuning stage, the model is trained to follow instructions in a QA format (Zhang et al., 2023b). We mostly use open-source datasets but also synthesize a math QA dataset to enhance the model's mathematical capabilities. A rundown of how we crafted the dataset is as follows. First, seed math data are collected from the Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset only, to avoid contamination with commonly used benchmark datasets such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Then, using a process similar to MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023), we rephrase the questions and answers of the seed math data. We use the resulting rephrased question-answer pairs as a QA dataset\n\nand call it 'Synth. Math-Instruct'.\n\nAlignment tuning. In the alignment tuning stage, the instruction-tuned model is further fine-tuned to be more aligned with human or strong AI ( e.g., GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023)) preferences using direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). Similar to the instruction tuning stage, we use mostly open-source datasets but also synthesize a math-focused alignment dataset utilizing the 'Synth. Math-Instruct' dataset mentioned in the instruction tuning stage.\n\nThe alignment data synthesis process is as follows. We take advantage of the fact that the rephrased question-answer pairs in Synth. Math-Instruct data are beneficial in enhancing the model's mathematical capabilities (see Sec. 4.3.1). Thus, we speculate that the rephrased answer to the rephrased question is a better answer than the original answer, possibly due to the interim rephrasing step. Consequently, we set the rephrased question as the prompt and use the rephrased answer as the chosen response and the original answer as the rejected response and create the {prompt, chosen, rejected} DPO tuple. We aggregate the tuples from the rephrased question-answer pairs and call the resulting dataset 'Synth. Math-Alignment'.\n\n## 4 Results\n\n## 4.1 Experimental Details\n\nTraining datasets. We present details regarding our training datasets for the instruction and alignment tuning stages in Tab. 1. We do not always use the entire dataset and instead subsample a set amount.

We also report data contamination results for SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct in Appendix C.\n\n## 4.3 Ablation Studies\n\nWe present ablation studies for both the instruction and alignment tuning stages.\n\n## 4.3.1 Instruction Tuning\n\nAblation on the training datasets. We present ablation studies using different training datasets for the instruction tuning in Tab. 3. The ablated models are prefixed with SFT for supervised finetuning. 'SFT v1' only uses the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, whereas 'SFT v2' also uses the OpenOrca dataset. 'SFT v3' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v2'. Similarly, 'SFT v4' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v1'.\n\nFirst, we analyze how Alpaca-GPT4 and OpenOrca affect the trained models. The first ablated model, 'SFT v1', which used only the AlpacaGPT4 dataset for training, resulted in 69 . 15 for H6. When we add the OpenOrca dataset to train the second ablated model, 'SFT v2', the resulting H6 score is 69 . 21 , which is little change from 69 . 15 of 'SFT v1'. However, the task scores vary more as 'SFT v2' gets a substantially higher GSM8K score of 57 . 32 compared to 52 . 24 of 'SFT v1' but also gets noticeably lower scores across the board for ARC, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA.

MathInstruct dataset is beneficial. For 'SFT v3', we add the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset, which boosts GSM8K scores to 64 . 14 and achieves comparable scores for the other tasks. Interestingly, when we add the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset to 'SFT v1' to train 'SFT v4', we get our highest H6 score of 70 . 88 with higher scores than 'SFT v3' for all tasks. From the above, we can see that adding the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset is helpful.\n\nLastly, we see whether merging models trained with and without OpenOrca can boost performance. In the first analysis, we saw that using OpenOrca resulted in a model that behaved differently from the model that was trained without OpenOrca. Building on this intuition, we merge 'SFT v3' and 'SFT v4' as they are the best-performing models with and without OpenOrca. To our surprise, the resulting merged model 'SFT v3+v4' retains the high scores for non-GSM8K tasks from 'SFT v4' but also achieves a higher GSM8K score than 'SFT v3' or 'SFT v4'. Thus, we see that merging models that specialize in different tasks is a promising way to obtain a model that performs well generally.\n\n## 4.3.2 Alignment Tuning\n\nAs we utilize DPO for practical alignment tuning, there are additional aspects to ablate such as the SFT base models used. Thus, we present ablations for the different training datasets used for training, the different SFT base models to initialize the DPO model, and finally, the model merging strategy to obtain the final alignment-tuned model.\n\nAblation on the training datasets. We ablate on the different alignment datasets used during DPO in Tab. 4. We use 'SFT v3' as the SFT base model for DPO. 'DPO v1' only uses the Ultrafeedback Clean dataset while 'DPO v2' also used the Synth. Math-Alignment dataset.\n\nFirst, we test how Ultrafeedback Clean and Synth. Math-Alignment impacts model performance. For 'DPO v1', it achieves 73 . 06 in H6, which is a substantial boost from the SFT base model score of 70 . 03 . However, we note that while scores for tasks like ARC, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA all improved by good margins, the score for GSM8K is 58 . 83 , which is lower than the SFT base model score of 64 . 14 . Adding Synth. Math-Alignment to train 'DPO v2', we see that the GSM8k score improves to 60 . 27 , which is lower than the SFT base model but still higher than 'DPO v1'.

Math- Instruct dataset is beneficial. For 'SFT v3', we add the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset, which boosts GSM8K scores to 64.14 and achieves comparable scores for the other tasks. Interestingly, when we add the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset to 'SFT v1' to train 'SFT v4', we get our highest H6 score of 70.88 with higher scores than 'SFT v3' for all tasks. From the above, we can see that adding the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset is helpful.\n\nLastly, we see whether merging models trained with and without OpenOrca can boost performance. In the first analysis, we saw that using OpenOrca re- sulted in a model that behaved differently from the model that was trained without OpenOrca. Build- ing on this intuition, we merge 'SFT v3' and 'SFT v4' as they are the best-performing models with and without OpenOrca. To our surprise, the result- ing merged model 'SFT v3+v4' retains the high scores for non-GSM8K tasks from 'SFT v4' but also achieves a higher GSM8K score than 'SFT v3' or 'SFT v4'. Thus, we see that merging models that specialize in different tasks is a promising way to obtain a model that performs well generally.\n\n## 4.3.2 Alignment Tuning\n\nAs we utilize DPO for practical alignment tuning, there are additional aspects to ablate such as the SFT base models used. Thus, we present ablations for the different training datasets used for training, the different SFT base models to initialize the DPO model, and finally, the model merging strategy to obtain the final alignment-tuned model.\n\nAblation on the training datasets. We ablate on the different alignment datasets used during DPO in Tab. 4. We use 'SFT v3' as the SFT base model for DPO. 'DPO v1' only uses the Ultrafeedback Clean dataset while 'DPO v2' also used the Synth. Math-Alignment dataset.\n\nFirst, we test how Ultrafeedback Clean and Synth. Math-Alignment impacts model perfor- mance. For 'DPO v1', it achieves 73.06 in H6, which is a substantial boost from the SFT base model score of 70.03. However, we note that while scores for tasks like ARC, HellaSwag, and Truth- fulQA all improved by good margins, the score for GSM8K is 58.83, which is lower than the SFT base model score of 64.14. Adding Synth. Math-Alignment to train 'DPO v2', we see that the GSM8k score improves to 60.27, which is lower than the SFT base model but still higher than 'DPO v1'.

Math-Alignment. Thus, we can conclude that adding Synth. MathAlignment is beneficial for H6.\n\nThen, we experiment whether merging 'DPO v1' and 'DPO v2' is beneficial. Unfortunately, 'DPO v1+v2' scores 73 . 21 in H6, which is worse than 'DPO v2'. More importantly, the gain in the GSM8K score from adding Synth. MathAlignment is gone, which is undesirable. One reason for this could be that 'DPO v2' is a strict improvement over 'DPO v1', unlike the case for merging 'SFT v3' and 'SFT v4' where the models had different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAblation on the SFT base models. When applying DPO, we start from a model that is already instruction tuned ,i.e., the SFT base model and ablate on using different SFT base models. We use Ultrafeedback Clean and Synth. Math-Alignment datasets for this ablation. Each of the ablated models is trained as follows. 'DPO v2' uses 'SFT v3' as the base SFT model, while 'DPO v3' uses 'SFT v3+v4' as the SFT base model instead.\n\nNote that 'SFT v3+v4' has higher scores on all tasks compared to 'SFT v3', and the gap is especially large for ARC ( +1 . 45 ) and GSM8K ( +2 . 43 ). Surprisingly, the two models perform similarly in terms of H6. A closer look at the scores for the individual tasks shows only a small margin in the GSM8K scores, and other task scores show little difference. Thus, the performance gaps in certain tasks in the SFT base models do not always carry over to the alignment-tuned models.\n\nAblation on different merge methods. From Tab. 3, we saw that merging two models that have different strengths can be beneficial to performance.\n\nTo utilize this for the alignment-tuned model as well, we train two models named 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' using the same training dataset and SFT base model as 'DPO v2' and 'DPO v3' but with different hyper-parameters to maximize each model's respective strengths. We compare 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' in Tab. 6 where we can see that 'Cand. 1' has high GSM8K scores but relatively low scores for the other tasks, whereas 'Cand. 2' has low scores for GSM8K but high scores for the other tasks. We merge these two models using various methods and ablate the results in Tab.. 7.\n\nWe use two merge methods: 1) Average ( a , b ), where a and b denote the weighting for 'Cand. 1' and 'Cand. 2' when averaging weights and 2) SLERP (Shoemake, 1985). We use ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 ), ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 6 ), and ( 0 . 6 , 0 . 4 ) for Average ( a , b ). From Tab. 7, we can see that the different merge methods have little effect on the H6 scores. The scores for the individual tasks also do not differ by much, suggesting that as long as the merge candidates have sufficiently different strengths, the exact merge method may not be as crucial. Thus, we chose 'Merge v1' as our SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct model.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe introduce SOLAR 10.7B and its fine-tuned variant SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct, which are depth upscaled (DUS) models with 10.7 billion parameters. They show superior performance over models like Llama 2, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral-7B-Instruct in essential NLP tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Thus, DUS is effective in scaling-up highly performant LLMs from smaller ones. With more exploration, DUS could be further improved, paving a new path to efficiently scaling LLMs.",

One key limitation is the need for more thorough explorations of hyperparameters used in the DUS approach. Namely, we removed m = 8 layers from both ends of our base model, primarily due to hardware limitations. However, we have not yet determined if this value is optimal for enhancing performance. The extended time and cost of continued pretraining made it challenging to conduct more comprehensive experiments, which we aim to address in future work through various comparative analyses.\n\nIn terms of the model's broader implications, there are several points to note. The model's significant computational demands for training and inference might limit its use, especially for those with restricted computational resources.

This has led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike previous language models, LLMs possess the\n\nability for In-context learning, including Zero-shot learning (Radford et al., 2019) and Few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020), allowing them to perform new tasks without updating model weights.

MoE models offer notable benefits, including enhanced output diversity, allowing for the capture of intricate patterns within the input space. Moreover, their computational efficiency, especially when implemented in a sparse form, has made them valuable in scenarios where resource constraints are a consideration (Shazeer et al., 2017; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022).\n\nHowever, efficient implementation of MoE models poses a considerable challenge, primarily due to the intricacies associated with dynamic routing and load-imbalanced computation (Gale et al., 2023).

      "pred_md": "plexity when compared to MoE. This shift in approach offers a unique and more straightforward way of working, moving away from conventional MoE challenges. Not only that, DUS also undergoes continued pretraining to quickly recover performance of the scaled model.\n\n## B.3 Prompt Engineering\n\nA key research area to harness the emergent abilities of LLMs is prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the study of how to design inputs (prompts) that enable LLMs to better perform specific tasks. A prime example of this research is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b), which proposes CoT prompting that decomposes multi-step problems into a series of intermediate reasoning steps. Moreover, efforts are underway to replace even such prompt engineering with LLMs (Yang et al., 2023).\n\n## B.4 Instruction Tuning\n\nTo enhance the steerability of LLMs, instruction tuning (Wei et al., 2021) has emerged as a learning technique. This involves fine-tuning LLMs using data formatted as (instruction, input, output) for various tasks (Wang et al., 2022). Instruction tuning allows for targeted adjustments, providing a more controlled and task-oriented improvement to the model's capabilities.\n\nBefore instruction tuning, existing methods faced challenges in effectively guiding and controlling the behavior of large language models (Zhang et al., 2023b). The sheer complexity of these models made it difficult to ensure precise and taskoriented responses. The need for a more targeted approach arose from the limitations of existing methods, leading to the development of instruction tuning. This targeted approach enables better control over the model's behavior, making it more suitable for specific tasks and improving its overall performance in alignment with user-defined objectives. Therefore, instruction tuning is computationally efficient and facilitates the rapid adaptation of LLMs to a specific domain without requiring extensive retraining or architectural changes.\n\n## B.5 Alignment Tuning\n\nLLM has been observed to generate sentences that may be perceived as linguistically incongruent by human readers since they learned not human intention, but only vast knowledge across various domains in the pretraining step (Ziegler et al., 2019).\n\nTo overcome this limitation and align with human intentions, previous research (Ziegler et al., 2019) have proposed Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF operates by learning a reward model based on human preferences, employing reinforcement learning to guide the LLM towards prioritizing answers with the highest reward scores. This process enhances the safety, propriety, and overall quality of the generated responses. Despite demonstrating satisfactory performance, RLHF encounters challenges such as managing numerous hyperparameters and necessitating the incorporation of multiple models (policy, value, reward, and reference models).\n\nIn response to these challenges, the supervised fine-tuning based approaches have proposed, such as Rank Responses to align Human Feedback (RRHF) (Yuan et al., 2023), Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT) (Dong et al., 2023), and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Intel, 2023). They avoid the complexities associated with reinforcement learning while achieving empirical performance comparable to RLHF. Among them, DPO that we used directly guides the LLM to increase the probability of positive responses and decrease the probability of negative responses through a \"direct\" approach. Interestingly, DPO demonstrates more stable learning results compared to RLHF, despite its simple training approach.\n\n## B.6 Data Contamination\n\nRecent researches (Zhou et al., 2023; Sainz et al., 2023; Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Deng et al., 2023) emphasize the need to measure whether a specific benchmark was used to train the large language models. There are three types of the data contamination: guideline, raw text and annotation (Sainz et al., 2023). Guideline contamination occurs when a model accesses detailed annotation guidelines for a dataset, providing advantages in specific tasks, and its impact should be considered, especially in zero and few-shot evaluations. Raw text contamination occurs when a model has access to the original text. Wikipedia is widely used as a pretraining data, but also as a source for creating new datasets. The caution is advised in the development of automatically annotated datasets sourced from the web. Annotation contamination occurs when the annotations of the specific benchmark are exposed during model training.",
